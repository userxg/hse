# Dual and Super position

## Dual bool function
- dual function - what is it?
- Ways to find it
	- Truth table ( just negation and reverse)
	- By arithmetic
- Dual theorem representing - how to get dual func from composites - ?

## Super Position
- Two operation
	- remaning
	- substitution

- Superposition - func that is received from function from F
- [[Closure]] - set of all superpositions `[F]`
- Closured function - ?
