# Def
- Operator - ?
- Isomorphic spaces - ?
- Th Either Two n size spaces are Isomorphic
- Conditions of Lineal Operator
- *Af* - matrix of lineal operator

## some Ths
- Th 1 -2 `A*X = B*X` and `X*B = X*A` where X matrix column
- Th 3- `Bf = T-1*Af*T` - choose from one operator to another 
- *Similar matrix* `D = T-1 * C * T`
- Th Dets of similar matrix are *equal*

## operations
- Multiplication 
- Th: Multiplication also linear oper
- Th: Matrix of Multiplication  Az = Af Ag
- Th: sum of the operators also linear oper
- Th: Matrix of sum  Az = Af + Ag

## non-singular oper
Df: Non-singular oper if matrix is non-[[singular]]
Th: F is non-singular -> it's injective and vice versa.
Th: n.n. F is injective if it translates *non-zero to non-zero*
Th: Multiplication of two non-singular also is non-singular
Df: inverse oper and theirs matrices
