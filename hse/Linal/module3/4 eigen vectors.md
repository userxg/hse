## Th F V->V => dim lm f = r, dim ker f = n - r, dim V = n
- Df: ker
- Df: lm

# Eigen vector and value
- Df:  fx= ax
- *Spectrum* - set of a1, a2, ... 
- Properties:
	1. Own vect has only one own value
	2. lin independent x1 and x2 with different own values
	3. AaX also eigen vect if aX eigen
	4. if x1, x2 eigen and lin. ind. -> x1 + x2 also own

## Characteristic polynomial
- How to find fi
- Th: in different basis are the same
- Th: k eigen val rank(Af) = r -> there're only n - r lin. ind. eigen vect
