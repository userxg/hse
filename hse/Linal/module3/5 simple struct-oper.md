Df: simple struct-oper <br>Df: When can *f* be diagonalizable <br>Th: to f be diagonalizable n.n. it is simple struct-oper <br>2Df: in complex and real spaces A is diagonalizable if there are *T* that T-1AT is diagonal.<br>Th: if a1...an different eigen values there're basis where A is diagonal <br>Th: about multiplicities of eigenvalues if *mi = n - ri*
