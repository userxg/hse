# intro
## definition
- increment in point  f = f'(x.)deltX + deltx g(x) - what is g(x)?
- When is the function differentiated - ? ( summ)
- What is *Df* 

## *N.E.C* differentiability F
- Df(x.) = f'(x.)deltX
	- N: divide deltX
	- Dx

## geometry meaning 
 - build default graphic 
 - f'(x.) = CB/deltX   ->  dF(x.) = 
 - meaning of it
 
## Rules for computing differential(same for derivative) 
 - 3 rules
 - *composite* d(f(g))
- meaning of [[invariance]]

## Derivatives of Higher orders
- Derivative of 2-nd order
- Derivative of n-rd order
- rules to count it
	- Cf
	- f + g
	- `F*G`
