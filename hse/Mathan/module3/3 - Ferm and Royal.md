# Parametrically, implicit, Ferma, Royal

## parametric setting of the function
1. exclude param
2. Use division( Y', Y'')

## Implicit setting
- ( Y', Y'')

## differential of highest orders
- D(n)Y = y(n)dx^n
- 3 Properties
- *Invariance properties are not being implemented* 



## Th Ferm 
- 4 conditions -> f(x.) = 0
- Proof through one sided derivatives
- Geom meaning
## Th Royall
- 3 conditions
- f(x.) either const
- or m < M -> By Ferm th there is at least one f(x.) = 0
- Geom meaning
